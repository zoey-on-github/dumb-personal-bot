# dumb-personal-bot  
(aka zoey doesn't know how git works: the repo)  
a neat little bot for my personal discord server, if you, for whatever reason, want to use this on your own server, be my guest. 
and if you want to become a tester, then you can hit me up at Julie Pilgrim#3328.  
bot is fully open, do whatever you want with this. 
# Usage
to run your own instance of this bot you'll need npm, which comes with [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), you'll also need [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js), [builders](https://github.com/discordjs/builders) and [discord-api-types](https://github.com/discordjs/discord-api-types) and to run it you can just run `node index.js`. You'll also need to provide your own config.json files with your discord bot id/guild id.
